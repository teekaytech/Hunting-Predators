### How to Play

#### Controls

##### Use arrow keys on your keyboard to play move the player around

- Left: Make the player accelerates towards left
- Right: Make the player accelerates towards right
- Up: Make the player accelerates upward
- down: Make the player accelerates downward
- Spacebar: Make the player shoots

### Logic

- Your goal as a player is to kill as many predators as you can, without coming in contact with the aliens.

**Predators**

**Aliens**

![aliens](assets/spritesheets/predator2.png)

- As you avoid coming in contact with the aliens, you must also ensure that the predators never make it to your farm (the green vertical line to the right).
- With every predator you kill, your score is increased by 10points.
- Your objective is to survive with the highest possible score.

### Input Your Name

- Although you can play the game without giving your name, doing so makes you stand a chance of making your name show on the scoreboard.
- If you are on the top 15, you can see yourself in the list.

### How this game was developed

#### Introduction

> My goal was to create a platform game (e.g. space shooter game) where a character can move around shooting the enemies.

#### Story and Gameplay

> I'm not the game type. In fact, I barely play games. This is because I hardly find games interesting. For that reason, it was a bit difficult for me to come up with a story. I came up with this story after getting some inspiration from a local movie I watched in the past. In that movie, the farmers in a particular community decided to hire some hunters to watch their farm for them against some predators. These predators are not killed by traps or poisons. So they believe that the hunters will kill the predators for them. From this, I was able to make the character kill the predators as they appear randomly. There's also a character of aliens: there are not here for the farm, they're here to eliminate the hunber. I designed the game in such a way that if any of the predators make it to the farm, the game is over. Also, if the aliens come in contact with the hunter, the game is over.

#### Choice of Assets

> In other to achieve the set goals, I used assets like the farm, background, predator spritesheet, aliens spritesheet and I chose one of the audio file found in a tutorial as background music.

#### Technical Knowhow

> understanding Phaser was a bit of a challenge. Therefore, I used the official documentation from Phaser. More often than none, I checked out a lot of examples from Phaser website and a couple of youtube videos.

#### Development Stage

> Since the goal is set, the design has been made and the assets ready to use, I started the development phase.

> I started by creating the different scenes in my game. This gives me some level of confidence because within the first few hours, I already have a deliverable.

> After that, I picked the scenes one after the other and added I preloaded the required assets. I also link the scenes all together according to the game design, so I can move freely from one scene to another.

> Next, I focused on the game scene, as this is the most complicated scene of all. I added logics to render player, farm, background, predators and aliens. I also added logics to animate predators, aliens and to make their movement. Having done these, I added logic to move the player around and to make the player shoot.

> I later added logics to monitor collision between the player and the aliens, predators and farms, shootings and predators. Lastly in the game scene, I added the score mechanism to keep track of each game session's scores.

> A player do not have to enter his/her name before playing the game. If a player did not enter his/her name, the only implication is that their score will not be stored in the game board.
